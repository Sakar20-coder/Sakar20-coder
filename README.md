👋 Hi, I’m @Sakar20-coder

👀 I’m interested in cybersecurity (red teaming FTW! 🔥), ethical hacking, and coding in Python, JavaScript, and Node.js.

🌱 I’m currently learning offensive security techniques, web app pentesting, and sharpening my skills in backend development.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source security tools, automation scripts, or anything that breaks (then fixes!) stuff.

📫 How to reach me:

⚡ Fun fact: I once wrote a Python script to automate my coffee orders… but I don’t even drink coffee. ☕🐍
